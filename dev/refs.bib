  abstract = {Using spatially non-uniform illumination significantly improves
              the resolution of light microscopy1. Indeed, frequency mixing
              between the object and the illumination permits the recovery of
              object frequencies beyond the diffraction-limited detection band
              pass2,3,4,5. However, the image reconstruction process requires a
              precise knowledge of the illumination patterns (usually focused or
              periodic) and therefore sophisticated stable mountings6,7. Here, we
              show, both theoretically and experimentally, that image
              reconstruction can be performed without knowing the illumination
              patterns, provided that their average is roughly homogeneous over
              the sample. Using blind structured illumination microscopy
              (blind-SIM), a resolution about two times better than that of
              conventional wide-field microscopy is obtained by simply
              illuminating the sample with several uncontrolled random speckles.
              Our approach is insensitive to specimen or aberration-induced
              illumination deformations, does not require any calibration step or
              stringent control of the illumination, and dramatically simplifies
              the experimental set-up.},
