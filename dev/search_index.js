A particular property of the OTF of a diffraction limited system is that it has a bounded support, which is a demonstration of the resolution limit. This can be intuited by the fact that frequencies outside of the support vecxi notin mathopsupp(H) are not observed in the sensed data i.e. tildeD(vecxi) = N(vecxi) and thus any two points within distance of the reciprocal of those frequencies 1vecxi are observed as if produced by a single point.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"In a regular structured illumination microscopy (SIM) set-up, we further assume that the emission is linearly dependent[5] on the illumination intensity","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"    E(vecx) = S(vecx)I(vecx)","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"In the frequency domain, using the convolution theorem as above, we have ","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"    tildeE(vecf) = tildeS(vecf) otimes tildeI(vecf) = int tildeS(vecf - vecxi) cdot tildeI(vecxi)  dvecxi","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"which is useful since the higher frequencies that are outside of the OTF support vecphi notin mathopsupp(H) are now reflected in the sensed data  tildeD as shifted into the support due to the convolution mathopsupp(H) ni vecf = vecphi - vecxi.
